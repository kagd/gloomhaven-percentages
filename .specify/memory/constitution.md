# Gloomhaven Percentages Constitution

## Core Principles

### Code Quality

All code must adhere to high standards of readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Use consistent coding conventions, meaningful variable names, and modular design. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes.

### Testing Standards

Since this is a POC we are going to omit testing for now. In future iterations, all features must include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests where applicable. Aim for at least 80% code coverage and ensure tests are automated and run in CI/CD pipelines.

### User Experience Consistency

The application must provide a consistent and intuitive user experience across all platforms and devices. Follow established UI/UX guidelines, ensure accessibility standards, and maintain consistent branding.

### Performance Requirements

The application must perform efficiently with response times under 2 seconds for common operations. Optimize for memory usage, minimize resource consumption, and monitor performance metrics.

## Development Workflow

Feature branches for development, pull requests for code review, automated testing gates, and deployment approvals.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require consensus from core contributors, documentation, and migration plan. All changes must verify compliance.
